## Inspiration
Eating from all the main food groups is something we learn when weâ€™re very young; however, when it comes to healthy eating, only a small proportion of the population actually follows the advice given by health professionals and dietitians.
- In 2017-18, just over half (51.3%) of Australians aged 18 years and over met the guidelines for the - recommended daily serves of fruit (2 or more serves). 
- One in thirteen (7.5%) adults met the guidelines for serves of vegetables (5-6 or more serves for men depending on age, and 5 or more for women). 
- The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported last year that 6.1% of adults ate the recommended amount of both fruit and vegetables [1] 
- Furthermore, less than half of all Australian adults get their recommended daily intake of calcium.

We say a gap in the education
